 the VMâ€™s main loop iterates through the
vm.instructions slice by incrementing its instruction pointer, ip, and using it as an index to
fetch the next opcode from vm.instructions. It also reads the operands from the same slice.
When it comes across a branching instruction, like OpJump, it changes the value of ip manually.
