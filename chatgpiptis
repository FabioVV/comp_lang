    Error Handling:
        You have good basic error handling, but you might want to further refine it. For instance, printing specific error messages based on different types of failures (file not found, permission errors, etc.) could enhance user experience.

    Dependency Management:
        Ensure that your custom packages like Evaluator, Lexer, Object, Parser, and Repl are well-documented and maintained. This will help other developers understand and contribute to your language.

    Performance Considerations:
        Depending on the complexity of your language and the expected size of the scripts, you may need to consider performance optimizations, especially in the parsing and evaluation stages.


Additional Features to Consider


    Interactive Features in REPL:
        Features like auto-completion, history recall, and syntax highlighting could significantly improve user experience in the REPL.

    Script Arguments:
        Allow scripts to receive command-line arguments. This can be done by passing additional arguments from os.Args to the script environment.

    Robust CLI:
        Consider using a third-party library like cobra or urfave/cli to handle command-line arguments more robustly. This can help manage multiple commands and options more cleanly.
