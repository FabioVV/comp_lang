Sure! Let's say you have a source file main.c in the directory /home/user/project/ and you want to include a header file named example.h.

If example.h is located in the same directory (/home/user/project/), you would use double quotes in your #include directive like this:

c
Copy code
#include "example.h"
If example.h is located in a system-wide directory or a directory specified in the compiler's search path, you would use angle brackets in your #include directive like this:

c
Copy code
#include <example.h>
Here's how the compiler would search for the file in each case:

Using Double Quotes:
Compiler looks for example.h in the same directory as main.c, i.e., /home/user/project/.
If example.h is found in that directory, it is included.
If not found, the compiler moves to the next step.
Using Angle Brackets:
Compiler looks for example.h in the system-wide directories specified in its search path.
If example.h is found in any of those directories, it is included.
If not found, the compiler reports an error unless you've configured additional directories to search.
Remember, the specific directories searched and how to configure additional directories can vary depending on your compiler and development environment.
